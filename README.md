# Classification Challenge - ML Models for ISP

## Background
Imaginary employee for an Internet Service Provider (ISP) and I've been tasked with improving the email filtering system for customers. The dataset used in this notebook contains information about emails, with two possible classifications: spam and not spam. Using those data I have created a supervised machine learning (ML) model that will accurately detect spam emails so it can filter them out of its customers' inboxes.


## Overview
This Jupyter notebook demonstrates the building and evaluating of two machine learning models, Logistic Regression and Random Forest, to classify emails as spam or not spam. The notebook follows specific steps to preprocess the data, train the models, make predictions, and evaluate their performance.

## Instructions
- Open the Notebook: Open the Jupyter notebook file  spam_classification_assignment.ipynb.
- Run All Cells: Execute all cells in the notebook to ensure all steps are followed and results are reproduced.
- Review Results: Review the predictions, model evaluations, and answers in the notebook.

## Steps 
1. Split the Data into Training and Testing Sets: This section involves splitting the dataset into training and testing sets to ensure the models can be properly trained and evaluated.
2. Scale the Features: This part focuses on scaling the feature data to improve the performance of the models. 
3. Created a Logistic Regression Model 
4. Created a Random Forest Model
5. Evaluated models: Accuracy score and performance of each model was evaluated to determine best model for given dataset. 

## Conclusion
The Random Forest Classifier performed better on the spam filtering dataset.
